# Assignment 2: Divergent Thinking

### Table of Contents

## About
**Name:** Snippets

**Target Audience:** Snippets will cater to working professionals seeking quick, concise updates on key work news, integrated within an app that allows personal interest discovery. 

**Value:** This app offers value by addressing the need for working professionals to quickly access reliable information, something current social media platforms struggle with due to the prevalence of fake news. By providing a dedicated, trustworthy news feed, professionals can stay informed with confidence through concise snippets. Integrating this feature into a social media app allows users to share insights and engage with others, while also interacting with a personalized feed that highlights their personal interests and passions.

## Scrapbook of Comparables
1. NewsBreak\
I like NewsBreak because it displays headlines from a variety of news sources, that is clearly labeled. They also have the option to input a zipcode to get local news, which is an important consideration for working professionals such as Douglas.

2. Flipboard\
Features of Flipboard that stand out to me include the "follow interests" option, which could greatly enhance the customization of a curated "For You" page. Flipboard’s organization into sections like Explore, Daily Edition, and Community is also beneficial, as it offers a clear structure for separating different categories for better user experience.

3. Tiktok\
Tiktok incorporated a Learn tab as an option for a feed, which helps to filter out educational vs the for you page. Could we apply it to have global news, local news, following and for you pages?\

TikTok supports multi-media posting, allowing users to share both images and videos in a single feed. We could leverage this feature to differentiate between quick news snippets and more in-depth reports, where videos offer additional context or details for users seeking a deeper dive into specific stories.

4. Flashfeed\
Custom news playlists is a very unique feature that I like from flashfeed. Could we implement an audio version of the news to keep users up to date while on the go and improve accessibility?

5. **Audio Content 2Go:** This feature allows users to listen to spoken versions of snippets content, making it easier to stay updated while commuting, multitasking, or for visual impairement accessibility.

6. **Topic Playlists:** Instead of the user curating their own favorites folder, we can curate content in a playlist form. 
7. **TapTrivia:** Have multiple layouts of multiple choice, short answer, etc. type of prompts that users can submit based on a topic/snippet.
8. **Broadcast Channels:** Allow verified users to create broadcast channels to improve engagement on the user's content.
9. **Layered Privacy:** Have more options to display posts based on the user's relationship with other users (public, friends, family, close friends)
10. **AI summarizer:** Use generative AI to summarize a topic playlist, favorites folder or other groups of content.
11. **Offline Content:** Enable the ability to save snippets to be viewed offline. This would be useful when commuting, where device connection is not stable. 
12. **Community Score:** Displays the user's positive contributions within the community. Users earn points through upvotes in the community discussions, highlighting the user’s expertise and engagement in that particular subject.
13. **Cross Share:** Enable seamless integration of content from other social media platforms into Snippets. This feature allows users, like Douglas, who rely on platforms such as Threads for on-demand news, to access and share content without changing their habits. 
14. **SnippetCollab:** Allow joint posts on snippets to allow for increased user visibility and streamline the collaboration process.
15. **Info tag:** Add labels to posts such as "Sponsored," "AI-Generated," and others, to keep users informed about the nature of the content they are viewing. This transparency helps users differentiate posts, enhancing trust and clarity.

## VSD Analysis
1. Stakeholders

- **Direct Stakeholders:** Users might face access issues with cross-shared media due to subscription restrictions.
- **Indirect Stakeholders:** External content creators gain exposure from cross-share but may not realize their content appears on other platforms.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  1. Implement a universal subscription option for media access.
  2. Include direct links and labels for external media to credit creators and identify the social media source.

- **Changing Hands:** A user's Community Score, based on their specific knowledge, loses credibility if the account changes ownership.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  Require multi-authentication for profile changes and adjust the Community Score if ownership changes.

2. Time

- **Appropriation by Cultural Groups:** The work-life mode may not accommodate daily prayer times for the Islamic community.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  Add a "break" screen feature to display prayer times in the work-life mode.

- **Sustained Friendships:** Users might struggle to maintain friendships if overwhelmed by educational or work content.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  Allow users to set specific times for prioritizing work/educational content, with personal and social content featured outside these times.

3. Values

- **Value Tensions:** The work mode may distract users from their tasks despite being intended to enhance productivity.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  Introduce a timer to manage screen time on Snippets and limit distractions.

4. Pervasiveness

- **Widespread Use:** Features like AI Summarizer, Communities, and Cross Share may be too resource-intensive if the user base grows quickly.

  **Design Consideration:** 
  Cap community sizes, make AI Summarizer optional, and limit Cross Share to partnered platforms to manage resource use and potential biases.
