## Hunch
I aim to explore how social media platforms can better integrate diverse interests and foster user engagement. How can social media platforms encourage users to explore and learn about new topics?

## Background Research
### [Likes vs Learnings Report](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2023/LikesVSLearning_Report.pdf)
**Protect students from overuse and addictive-like behavior**
- Stop training algorithms to maximize user screen time, reducing overuse and addictive behaviors.
- Remove autoplay and infinite scroll to prevent compulsive content consumption.
    - e.g. Instagram added additional content on a user’s feed in addition to their following
- Disable push notifications for students during school hours and sleep times to minimize distractions.
    - Default push notifications are really disruptive to me, which pushed me to the extreme of becoming what's called a "DnD (Do Not Disturb) warrior." However, this habit caused me to easily miss messages, as the suppressed notifications made it hard for me to keep track once I turn off the feature.

**Protect students from risky algorithms**
- Stop algorithms from recommending harmful and traumatic content to students, prioritizing safety over engagement.
- Give students the option to turn off or reset content recommender algorithms to avoid harmful content loops.
    - Some young people may want to escape rabbit holes or filter bubbles, especially
    if they have become problematic.
- Work with trusted sources to demote misinformation and disinformation, especially around health and elections.

### [Industry Viewpoint: The impact of educational content on social media](https://theproducenews.com/headlines/industry-viewpoint-impact-educational-content-social-media)
- Social media platforms have become increasingly popular among Gen Z as a source of education, surpassing traditional search engines. A danger related to this shift is the spread of misinformation on social media platforms, as cross-checking sources is not as straightforward as with a search engine.
- Educational influencers have recently emerged and gained popularity on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Learning has become more accessible, engaging, and entertaining through formats like short videos and infographics.
- Although educational content is abundant on social media, the algorithms used by these platforms hinder this content from being displayed if the user doesn't engage with it, potentially leading users down a rabbit hole of non-educational content.

## Interview 1: Douglas
### Interviewee Justification
Douglas, a senior consultant at EY Singapore from Jakarta, Indonesia, actively engages with social media for both personal and professional purposes. His experience sharing his diving adventures and life stories across these platforms provides valuable insights from the perspective of both a content creator and consumer. Additionally, his use of social media to stay informed about industry-related news offers a unique professional lens.

### Report 
Instagram is his go-to platform for posting and staying updated on friends' activities, personal interests, and trending news. He uses Facebook primarily for marketplace transactions and accessing regional news from Singapore and Indonesia, while X serves as his main news aggregator. Interestingly, Douglas deliberately “avoids TikTok”, citing the platform’s steep learning curve and complex features. 

A striking revelation was Douglas's limited daily phone usage of just 3 hours, which seems at odds with his up-to-date knowledge of AI news. This contradiction highlights the efficiency of his social media engagement, particularly on X: "Gets a lot of new current information for AI... not from their website or reddit." His comment that social media "takes me out of my work bubble for a bit" unveils a tension between productivity and relaxation, suggesting that brief social media interactions serve as a form of micro-break in his busy schedule.Douglas's experience also exposed an alarming gap in content moderation. He shared a disturbing observation: “Explore page on terrorist activities that are explicit... don't want to see this on Instagram" This unexpected exposure to sensitive content raises serious questions about the effectiveness of content filtering algorithms and the potential risks users face while casually browsing.

### Design Opportunities
1. Simplified social media features

I envision a platform with simplified, user-friendly features to help new users quickly adapt to social media functionalities. This approach, incorporating interactive tutorials and personalized guidance, aims to increase inclusivity and user engagement across diverse experience levels.

2. News Personalization

A personalized news aggregation feature for work-related content could greatly benefit users like Douglas who rely on social media for professional updates. This feature would curate relevant news, making it easier to access important information quickly, especially for those with limited daily phone usage.

3. Cross Platform Integration

Douglas's observation of distinct news types across social media platforms suggests an opportunity for a cross-platform news aggregation feature. This tool could compile and cross-reference content from various sources, though implementation may face challenges regarding permissions from different platforms.

## Interview 2: Arya
### Interviewee Justification
Arya, a high school student, primarily uses social media to stay connected with peers and engage with relatable, entertaining content. As part of a younger demographic, Arya offers valuable insights into emerging trends and content that are often less explored by older audiences.

### Report 
Arya offered a contrasting perspective that challenges the notion of social media as merely a distraction for teenagers. For instance, Arya's use of Snapchat as a replacement for traditional messaging apps demonstrates how younger users are turning to platforms with more offerings. Instagram and Tiktok are used for entertainment at times of boredom, but it offers more than that. A surprising aspect of Arya's social media usage was his engagement with educational content, particularly on TikTok. This contradicts the common perception of TikTok as purely entertainment-focused. 

Arya's statement, "TikTok varies posts between videos and pictures, unlike Instagram, where you have to go into a specific section to watch Reels videos," highlights the importance of media variariation and accessibility in social media design. Perhaps the most insightful moment came when Arya suggested a feature improvement: "They can probably put a filter section where you can filter out what you want to watch." This recommendation reveals a tension between the desire for personalized content and the need for broader exposure.

### Design Opportunities
1. Customizable filters for content 

A great opportunity to Implement a user-controlled filter system that allows users to specify the types of content they wish to see (e.g., educational, entertainment, or specific topics). This allows people like Arya to cater his feed to more educational content for a more enriching social media experience. 

2. Seamless Media Variation in User Feeds

Optimize media diversity within social media feeds by seamlessly blending video, image, and text content, similar to TikTok's approach. This enables users to explore various media types and empowers content creators to select the most effective format for conveying their message, maximizing information sharing.

3. Personalized Discovery Modes

Implement a feature allowing users to switch between personalized feeds and discovery modes, exposing them to diverse topics. This dual-mode system balances familiar content with new ideas, encouraging users to explore beyond their comfort zone while maintaining the option for personalization.
